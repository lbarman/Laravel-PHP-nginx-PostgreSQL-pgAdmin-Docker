The intent of the project is to have a fully-tested dockerized PHP website.

What works:

- Website with Laravel, in its own docker
- PHP in his own docker with php fpm
- PostgresSQL server
- PGAdmin
- Selenium for tests

Todo:

- `make serve` to build and serve
- `make test` to test (assumes things are running already)
